## Data Management Course Assignments - MySQL Database Practice
#### Introduction:
This GitHub repository contains the MySQL database practice assignments I completed during the Data Management course. In this course, I learned the fundamental concepts of relational databases and the usage of MySQL database management systems. The assignments cover aspects of database design, data modeling, SQL queries, and data management, along with relevant Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD) and MySQL code.
#### Content Overview:
* Database Design and Modeling: 
In the initial phase of the course, I learned how to design and model databases. Analyzing the given requirements, I created an ERD to illustrate the entities, attributes, and relationships of the database, building a comprehensive data model.

* SQL Queries and Data Operations: 
Subsequently, I acquired skills in using SQL query language to perform database operations. Throughout the assignments, I crafted a series of SQL queries, encompassing data insertion, deletion, modification, and retrieval, catering to various business needs.

* Data Integrity and Security: 
Ensuring data integrity and security is crucial in database management. I learned how to set up constraints and permissions to safeguard the data within the database effectively.

* Database Performance Optimization: 
Beyond basic data management, I also delved into database performance optimization. By creating indexes and fine-tuning query statements, I aimed to enhance the database's query efficiency and response time.
